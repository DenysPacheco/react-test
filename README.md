React is nice because it centralizes the interface of data access (i.e.: `State` or [SSOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth); or at least it should be a good practice ü§∑), so any functionality that couples with the interface (or props) will have direct effect on other as well.

### Critique

#### Cons

- Hard to start (like anything)
- Data flow can be confusing (but I'm a starter, so...)
- Maintaining means lots of change in the flow for once minimal view change (depending how you structure)

#### Pros

- It's fun (my opnion)
- Simple to code or easy to create (since it's js and everything is connected)
- Like said above, auto coupling of functionalitys since linked on a state
- ‚ú® No reaload of pages for content üòç
